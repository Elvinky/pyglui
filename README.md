pyglui
======

Cython powered OpenGL gui.

* Similar to AntTweakBar but truly python compatible. No need for ctyped variables.

* Uses render-to-texture for ulta low cpu use when static.

* Designed to be used with glfw but should run with other window managers as well.

* Includes [pyfontstash](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyglui/tree/master/pyglui/pyfontstash) for rendering text.

* Includes [cygl](https://github.com/pupil-labs/pyglui/tree/master/pyglui/cygl) to access GL functions (which in turn uses [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/))

* cygl and pyfontstash can also be installed separately but are hosted in this project for convenience.
